Installation
============

AllenSPARQL was created with NetBeans 8.1, but it should also compile directly with
Maven. If you can't open the project in NetBeans, make sure that you have the Maven
plugins installed.

To build the source code, run "mvn install".

It might be necessary to install the jar file for D2RQ manually beforehand. To do this,
download D2RQ 0.8.1 and run (inside the lib directory):

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=d2rq-0.8.1.jar -DgroupId=d2rq -DartifactId=d2rq -Dversion=0.8.1 -Dpackaging=jar

AllenSPARQL uses a slightly modified version of "sagecell-client.py" (see: https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/blob/master/contrib/sagecell-client/
sagecell-client.py). To support deriving inferences via SageMathCell, install Python and make sure that that "sagecell-client.py" works on your system. Make sure to follow
the documentation of the script, as it requires the installation of two Python 
libraries.
