# AllenSPARQL

AllenSPARQL is an RDF- and SPARQL based temporal phenotyping engine. It can be used to translate and execute temporal phenotyping queries which have been created with the AllenGUI tool (see: https://github.com/sebmate/AllenGUI), into SPARQL queries. The tool uses i2b2, D2RQ, Fuseki 2, Python, "sagecell-client.py" (see: https://github.com/sagemath/sagecell/blob/master/contrib/sagecell-client/) and SageMathCell (see: https://sagecell.sagemath.org/).

The program is based on Allen's interval algebra, which has been described in Allen, James F. "Maintaining knowledge about temporal intervals." Communications of the ACM 26.11 (1983): 832-843.

For information on how to build the source code and how to play around with the small demo dataset, please follow "Quick Start Guide.docx".
